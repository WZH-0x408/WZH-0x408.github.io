The project aims to find a novel approach to identify differences in encrypted network traffic from different sources(apps, websites, proxies, etc.) and find a novel approach to effectively classify them. The project expects to leverage machine learning methods to generate embeddings from raw encrypted traffic for effective classification.

Currently, different datsets have been collected and a framework has been constructed based off [nprintML](https://nprint.github.io/nprintml/) for integration future machine learning procedure. In the process, I have contributed to data pre-processing stage, which generates labeled data from raw .pcap binary files. In addition, I have reproduced the [ET-BERT model](https://github.com/linwhitehat/ET-BERT), a method based on BERT architecture which achieved SOTA performance.
